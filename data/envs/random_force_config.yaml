# Random force perturbation settings for robustness training
# This config is shared across different training methods (AMP, ADD, etc.)
# Edit this file to change force settings for all training methods

enable_random_force: True
random_force_scale: [0.0, 0.0, -100.0]  # Maximum force magnitude in Newtons [x, y, z]
random_force_bodies: ["left_wrist_yaw_link", "right_wrist_yaw_link"]  # Bodies to apply forces to
visualize_forces: True  # Draw red arrows showing force direction (only when visualize=True)

# Curriculum learning settings
force_curriculum: True  # Gradually increase force magnitude over training
# When True, forces start at 0% and reach 100% over 192,000 steps (6000 iters × 32 steps/iter)
# Forces remain constant within each episode, but max magnitude increases over training

# Note: Forces are constant for entire episode duration (no decay within episode)
# Each episode gets a random force magnitude between 0 and (current_curriculum_scale × random_force_scale)
